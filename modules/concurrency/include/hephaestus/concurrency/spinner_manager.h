/// This allows to catch errors in spinner execution as soon as possible and stop the others.
/// NOTE: right now we do not have any concept of error for the spinners: we cannot know if a spinner
/// terminated with an error or not. If an exception is thrown inside the runner, it will be re-throwed when
/// we call runner.stop().get(). We leave it to the user to handle it outside of the runner manager.
/// NOTE: this logic is quite generic and can be extended to any type of object that has `wait()` and `stop()`
/// methods. To be faitful to the principle of implement only what you need now, we limit the scope to
/// spinners and consider to expand the scope when an use case arises.
